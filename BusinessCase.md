Ontario Tech University is launching the AI Digital Assistant Program (AIDAP) to unify and modernize its academic systems. Current tools, such as the LMS, registration, and scheduling platforms, operate separately, resulting in inconsistent data and limited real-time insights. AIDAP solves this by providing a centralized, AI-powered assistant that uses natural language processing to deliver personalized responses and automate information retrieval.

Through secure integration with university systems, users can access grades, schedules, notifications, and analytics from a single interface via text, web, or voice. The system supports 5,000 concurrent users, maintains 99.5% uptime, responds in under two seconds, and protects data through SSO, encryption, and rapid backup and recovery.

By streamlining communication and automating routine processes, AIDAP improves efficiency, reduces administrative workload, and strengthens decision-making. It offers students and lecturers a personalized digital experience and provides administrators with clearer institutional visibility. Overall, AIDAP demonstrates Ontario Tech’s commitment to innovation and digital transformation.
