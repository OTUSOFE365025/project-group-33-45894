Ontario Tech University will be launching the AI Digital Assistant Program (AIDAP) to modernize automation, and data management across its academic systems. Existing online tools such as the LMS, registration, and scheduling platforms operated in isolation, which creates inconsistencies, duplicated data, and limited access to real-time insights. These challenges emphasize the need for a unified, intelligent program capable of connecting institutional systems and simplifying user interaction.

AIDAP is designed as a centralized, AI-powered assistant that uses natural language processing to provide personalized responses and automate information retrieval. Through a secure connection with university systems, it enables students, lecturers, and administrators to access grades, schedules, notifications, and analytics from a single interface by text, web, or voice. This system’s architecture supports 5,000 concurrent users, ensures 99.5 percent uptime, and gives responses in under two seconds. Data protection is maintained through Single Sign-On authentication, encryption, and automated backup and recovery within minutes of failure.

By merging communication and automating processes, AIDAP improves efficiency, reduces administrative workload, and enhances decision making through predictive analysis. For students and lecturers, it offers a simple, personalized digital experience, for administrators, it provides clear institutional visibility and improved data driven planning. In conclusion, AIDAP reflects Ontario Tech’s commitment to innovation, accessibility, and the ongoing digital transformations of higher education.
