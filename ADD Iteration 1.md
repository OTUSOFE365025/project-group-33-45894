<h1>Iteration 1</h1>
<h3>(establishing a general overview)</h3><br>


<h2>Step 1: Review Inputs</h2>
<h3>(design objectives, primary functional requirements, quality attribute scenarios, contstraints, concerns)</h3><br>

<h2>Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal</h2>
<h3>(select drivers)</h3><br>

<h2>Step 3: Decompose</h2>
<h3>(choose element(s) of the system to decompose)</h3><br>

<h2>Step 4: Choose Design Concept(s) </h2>
<h3>(satisfy the inputs considered in the iteration)</h3>
*NOTE include choice of reference architecture / framework along with justifications
<br>

<h2>Step 5: Elements, Responsibilities and Interfaces</h2>
<h3>(instantiate architectural elemtents, allocate responsiblities and define interfaces)</h3>
*NOTE include major components of the architecture <br>
**NOTE include domain specific components <br>
***NOTE include interface specification (both internal and external)
<br>


<h2>Step 6: Sketch and Record</h2>
<h3>(sketch views and record design decisions)</h3>
*NOTE include deployment diagram<br>
**NOTE include domain specific models<br>
<br>

<h2>Step 7: Analysis and Review</h2>
<h3>(perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal + design objectives)</h3><br>
