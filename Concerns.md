Architectural Concerns 

| ID | Concern | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| CRN-1 | Integration with institutional systems (LMS, registration, calendars, email) | The AI assistant must reliably interface with multiple external university data sources using secure APIs. Failure or misalignment across systems risks inconsistent or outdated information being presented to users. |
| CRN-2 | Data privacy and compliance | Sensitive academic and personal data are exchanged frequently. The architecture must comply with institutional privacy standards and ensure end-to-end encryption, role-based access, and audit logging. |
| CRN-3 | AI model management and versioning | The assistant will rely on evolving AI models. The design must allow maintainers to update or roll-back model versions without disrupting service or user experience. |
| CRN-4 | Scalability and availability for peak usage | High concurrent loads ( start of term, registration deadlines, etc) demand dynamic scaling to maintain performance and 99.5% uptime. |
| CRN-5 | Response latency and real-time interaction | Conversations must feel instantaneous, the architecture must ensure average response times under 2 seconds (RS10). |
| CRN-6 | Context management and personalization | The system must store and recall past interactions per user while preventing cross-user data leakage. This introduces design challenges in secure state management. |
| CRN-7 | Cross-platform accessibility | The assistant must operate consistently across web, mobile, and voice-assistant devices, requiring uniform interface contracts and adaptive UI design. |
| CRN-8 | Extensibility for future AI services | The architecture should allow new features ( new AI APIs, external data connectors, etc) with minimal refactoring. |
| CRN-9 | Monitoring and fault tolerance | Continuous monitoring and graceful failure handling are essential for reliability. The system must support automatic retry and recovery for failed API calls. |
